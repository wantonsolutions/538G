q1)

Still working through this but hope is in sight. At the moment I have
gone through two examples. In both I defined enums for the named
types, and used an array of integers for the numeric types. I applied
the one-to one function to each of them, then constraied each by the
rules of the puzzle. In all cases I could not get an answer. I have
heard that there is some sample code to help me along though.

q2)

After suggetstions in class it is apparent that low must be greater
than or equal to high in some cases. Modification made on line 54

s.add(Or(low > high, And(0 <= low, low < high)))
-------------------------------------------------
s.add(Or(low >= high, And(0 <= low, low < high)))
